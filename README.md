Dear Tutor,

I have uploaded my codes, outputs and some unseen images data onto blackboard.\
But for your easy marking, I would suggest you to pull the repo from https://github.com/tmwong5694/STAT6207. Please be noted that it will take some time to download the images from kaggle.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if you experience any issue in running my codes.

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,\
Tim
